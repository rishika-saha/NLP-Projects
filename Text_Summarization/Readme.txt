
Text Summarzation deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of texts.
Over here I have tried to extract data from Wikipedia and then cleaned the data.
After that we have converted the text into sentences and found the weighted frequency
of the occurrences of all the words.By dividing the weighted frequency of each word's 
frequency by the frequency of the most occurring word we can find the weighted frequncy.
Then we need to sum the weighted frequnecy with the original text(no square brackets and
extra brackets) and then sort them in descending order of sum.The sentences with highest 
frequencies summarize the text.
